    <h1>Dear Web Surfer,</h1>

    <p>Thanks for checking out my site! I apologize for the lack of frontend - it's hard ðŸ˜…</p>

    <p>In case you're interested, here's a little self introduction. I, Naveen Kannan, am a sophomore majoring in mathematics at Stanford University.</p>

    <p>I'm always exploring algorithms and ml concepts, and every once in a while I find/do something interesting. Check it out: <a href="GITHUB_LINK">Github</a>.</p>

    <p>Recently, I've grown profoundly interested in machine interpretability and love thinking about, well, how machines think. If you also tend to think, please reach out!</p>

    <p>Regarding my formal experience, I have worked as an AI Innovation Intern at Virtualitics on the GenAI R&D team, and as a Research Intern with the Research Science Institute (RSI).</p>

    <p>Want to connect? Shoot me a message anytime: <a href="linkedin.com/in/naveenkannan0">in/naveenkannan0</a> or <a href="mailto:naveenkc@stanford.edu">naveenkc [at] stanford [dot] edu</a></p>
